15] Given A Triangle ABC, How Would You Use Only A Compass And Straight Edge To Find A Point P Such That Triangles ABP, ACP And BCP Have Equal Perimeters? (Assume That ABC Is Constructed So That A Solution Does Exist.)

This Is The Isoperimetric Point, Which Is At The Center Of The Larger Soddy Circle. It Is Related To Apollonius' Problem. The Three Tangent Circles Are Easy To Construct: The Circle Around Has Diameter, Which Gives The Other Two Circles. A Summary Of Compass And Straightedge Constructions For The Outer Soddy Circle Can Be Found In "Apollonius' Problem: A Study Of Solutions And Their Connections" By David Gisch And Jason M. Ribando.
